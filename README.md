# Recommendation Engine with Tensorflow Recommenders

This project implements a recommendation system using TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS). The system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations based on user interactions such as searches, clicks, add-to-cart actions, and purchases. The dataset used consists of user interaction data from an e-commerce platform.  

## Features

- **User Interaction Data**: Utilizes various user interactions including searches, clicks, add-to-cart actions, and purchases to generate recommendations.
- **TensorFlow Recommenders**: Leverages TFRS to build, train, and evaluate the recommendation models.
- **Embeddings**: Uses embeddings for users and items to capture latent features and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Query Search**: Allows recommendations based on product search queries, product names, categories, and characteristics.
- **Retrieval Model**: Focuses on efficient retrieval of the most relevant products for a given user query.
- **Ranking Ordering**: Optimizes the ranking of recommended products based on user preferences and relevance.
- **Customizable**: Easy to extend with additional features and interactions.
